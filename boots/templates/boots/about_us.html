								<h4 class="info-title">Active ETH & BTC Management</h4>
								<p>
									For firms that have recently completed a successful ICO and hold significant Ether (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC) reserves or anyone with significant ETH or BTC holdings, Coin Boost believes a passive hold strategy can pose undue market risk considering the extremely volatile nature of the digital currency markets. 
									Investment of all or a portion of such currency holdings in fund strategies that in turn will trade, invest and/or lend across multiple digital asset classes, and are actively managed by Coin Boost’s dedicated team of experienced professionals, may offer a more attractive risk alternative to those holding significant uninvested ETH or BTC.

								<h4 class="info-title">Early Stage Blockchain Investing</h4>
								<p>
									Coin Boost meticulously analyzes and tracks what it views as the most promising technologies built on the blockchain. 
									Its management team has reviewed the investment merits of thousands of projects and developed a proprietary seven pillar due diligence process for screening new ventures. 
									Less than one percent of projects Coin Boost’s investment team reviews make the cut for inclusion within fund investment portfolios.
